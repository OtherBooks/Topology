  \emph{Theorem (General principle of recursive definition).}
  Let $J$ be a well-ordered set; let $C$ be a set.
  Let $\cF$ be the set of all functions mapping sections of $J$ into $C$.
  Given a function $\r : \cF \to C$, there is a unique $h : J \to C$ such that $h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a)$ for each $\a \in J$.

  Following the hint, we follow the pattern of Exercise~10.10.
  In what follows denote by $(*)$ the property
  \gath{
    h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a)
  }
  for a function $h$ from $J$ or a section of $J$ to $C$.
  
  \begin{lem}\label{lem:sewo:hunique}
    If $h$ and $k$ map sections of $J$, or all of $J$, into $C$ and satisfy $(*)$ for all $x$ in their respective domains, then $h(x) = k(x)$ for all $x$ in both domains.
  \end{lem}
  \qproof{
    First suppose that the domains of $h$ and $k$ are sets $H$ and $K$ where each is either a section of $J$ or $J$ itself.
    Since this is the case, we can assume without loss of generality that $H \ss K$  and so $H$ is exactly the domain common to both $h$ and $k$.
    Now suppose that the hypothesis we are trying to prove is \emph{not} true so that there is an $x$ in both domains (i.e. $x \in H$) where $h(x) \neq k(x)$.
    We can also assume that $x$ is the smallest such element since $H \ss J$ and $J$ is well-ordered.
    It then clearly follows that $S_x \ss H$ is a section of $J$ and that $h(y) = k(y)$ for all $y \in S_x$.
    From this we clearly have that $h \rest S_x = k \rest S_x$ so that
    \gath{
      h(x) = \r(h \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x) = k(x)
    }
    since both $h$ and $k$ satisfy $(*)$ and $x$ is in the domain of both.
    This contradicts the supposition that $h(x) \neq k(x)$ so that it must be that no such $x$ exists and hence $h$ and $k$ are the same in their common domain as desired.
  }

  \begin{lem} \label{lem:sewo:hsucc}
    If there exists a function $h: S_\a \to C$ satisfying $(*)$, then there exists a function $k : S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \to C$ satisfying $(*)$.
  \end{lem}
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $h : S_\a \to C$ is such a function satisfying $(*)$.
    Now let $\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$ and we define $k : \bar{S}_\a \to C$ as follows.
    For any $x \in \bar{S}_\a$ set
    \gath{
      k(x) = \begin{cases}
        h(x) & x \in S_\a \\
        \r(h) & x = \a \,.
      \end{cases}
    }
    We note that clearly $S_\a$ and $\braces{\a}$ are disjoint so that this is unambiguous.
    We also note that $h$ is a function from a section of $J$ to $C$ so that $h \in \cF$ and $\r(h) \in C$ is therefore defined.

    Now we show that $k$ satisfies $(*)$.
    First, clearly $h \rest S_x = k \rest S_x$ for any $x \leq \a$ since $k(y) = h(y)$ by definition for any $y \in S_x \ss S_\a$.
    Now consider any $x \in \bar{S}_\a$.
    If $x = \a$ then by definition we have
    \gath{
      k(x) = \r(h) = \r(h \rest S_\a) = \r(k \rest S_\a) = \r(k \rest S_x)
    }
    since clearly $h = h \rest S_\a$ since $S_\a$ is the domain of $h$.
    On the other hand, if $x \in S_\a$ then $x < \a$ so that
    \gath{
      k(x) = h(x) = \r(h \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x)
    }
    since $h$ satisfies $(*)$.
    Therefore, since $x$ was arbitrary, this shows that $k$ also satisfies $(*)$.
  }

  \begin{lem}\label{lem:sewo:hunion}
    If $K \ss J$ and for all $\a \in K$ there exists a function $h_\a : S_\a \to C$ satisfying $(*)$, then there exists a function
    \gath{
      k : \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a \to C
    }
    satisfying $(*)$.
  \end{lem}
  \qproof{
        Let
    \gath{
      k = \bigcup_{\a \in K} h_\a \,,
    }
    which we claim is the function we seek.

    First we show that $k$ is actually a function from $\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a$ to $C$.
    So consider any $x$ in the domain of $k$.
    Suppose that $(x, a)$ and $(x, b)$ are both in $k$ so that there are $\a$ and $\b$ in $K$ where $(x, a) \in h_\a$ and $(x, b) \in h_\b$.
    Since $h_\a$ and $h_\b$ both satisfy $(*)$, it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hunique} that $a = h_\a(x) = h_\b(x) = b$ since clearly $x$ is in the domain of both.
    This shows that $k$ is indeed a function since $(x,a)$ and $(x,b)$ were arbitrary.
    Also clearly the domain of $k$ is $\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a$ since, for any $x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a$, we have that there is an $\a \in K$ where $x \in S_\a$.
    Hence $x$ is in the domain of $h_\a$ and so in the domain of $k$.
    In the other direction, clearly if $x$ is in the domain of $k$ then it is in the domain of $h_\a$ for some $\a \in K$.
    Since this domain is $S_\a$, clearly $x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a$.
    Lastly, obviously the range of $k$ can be $C$ since this is the range of every $h_\a$.

    Now we show that $k$ satisfies $(*)$.
    So consider any $x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a$ so that $x \in S_\a$ for some $\a \in K$.
    Clearly we have that $k(y) = h_\a(y)$ for every $y \in S_\a$ since $h_\a \ss k$.
    It then immediately follows that $k(x) = h(x)$ and $k \rest S_x = h_\a \rest S_x$ since $S_x \ss S_\a$.
    Then, since $h_\a$ satisfies $(*)$, we have
    \gath{
      k(x) = h_\a(x) = \r(h_\a \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x) \,.
    }
    Since $x$ was arbitrary, this shows that $k$ satisfies $(*)$ as desired.

  \begin{lem} \label{lem:sewo:hind}
    For every $\b \in J$, there exists a function $h_\b : S_\b \to C$ satisfying $(*)$.
  \end{lem}
  \qproof{
    We show this by transfinite induction.
    So consider any $\b \in J$ and suppose that, for every $x \in S_\b$, there is a function $h_x : S_x \to C$ satisfying $(*)$.
    Now, if $\b$ has an immediate predecessor $\a$ then we claim that $S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$.
    First if $x \in S_\b$ then $x < \b$ so that $x \leq \a$ since $\a$ is the immediate predecessor of $\b$.
    If $x < \a$ then $x \in S_\a$ and if $x = \a$ then $x \in \braces{\a}$.
    Hence in either case we have that $x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$.
    Now suppose that $x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$.
    If $x \in S_\a$ then $x < \a < \b$ so that $s \in S_\b$.
    On the other hand if $x \in \braces{\a}$ then $x = \a < \b$ so that again $x \in S_\b$.
    Thus we have shown that $S_\b \ss S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$ and $S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \ss S_\b$ so that $S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$.
    Since $\a \in S_\b$ it follows that there is an $h_\a : S_\a \to C$ that satisfies $(*)$.
    Then, by Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hsucc}, we have that there is an $h_\b : S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \to C$ that also satisfies $(*)$.

    If $\b$ does not have an immediate predecessor then we claim that $S_\b = \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g$.
    So consider any $x \in S_\b$ so that $x < \b$.
    Since $x$ cannot be the immediate predecessor of $\b$, there must be an $\a$ where $x < \a < \b$.
    Then $x \in S_\a$ so that, since $\a < \b$, clearly $x \in \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g$.
    Now suppose that $x \in \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g$ so that there is an $\a < \b$ where $x \in S_\a$.
    Then clearly $x < \a < \b$ so that also $x \in S_\b$.
    Thus we have shown that $S_\b \ss \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g$ and $\bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g \ss S_\b$ so that $S_\b = \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g$.
    Now, clearly $S_\b$ is a subset of $J$ where there is an $h_x : S_x \to C$ satisfying $(*)$ for every $x \in S_\b$.
    Then it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hunion} that there is a function $h_\b$ from $\bigcup_{\g < S_\b} S_\g = \bigcup_{\g < \b} S_\g = S_\b$ to $C$ that satisfies $(*)$.

    Therefore, in either case, we have shown that there is an $h_\b : S_\b \to C$ that satisfies $(*)$.
    The desired result then follows by transfinite induction.
    }
    
  \mainprob
  \qproof{
    First suppose that $J$ has no largest element.
    Then we claim that $J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a$.
    For any $x \in J$ there must be a $y \in J$ where $x < y$ since $x$ cannot be the greatest element of $J$.
    Hence $x \in S_y$ so that also clearly $\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a$.
    Then, for any $x \in \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a$, there is an $\a \in J$ where $x \in S_\a$.
    Clearly $S_\a \ss J$ so that $x \in J$ also.
    Hence $J \ss \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a$ and $\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a \ss J$ so that $J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a$.
    Since we know from Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hind} that there is an $h_\a : S_\a \to C$ that satisfies $(*)$ for every $\a \in J$, it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hunion} that there is a function $h$ from $\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a = J$ to $C$ that satisfies $(*)$.

    If $J$ does have a largest element $\b$ then clearly $J = S_\b \cup \braces{\b}$.
    Since we know that there is an $h_\b : S_\b \to C$ that satisfies $(*)$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hind}, it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hsucc} that there is a function $h$ from $S_\b \cup \braces{\b} = J$ to $C$ that satisfies $(*)$.
    Hence the desired function $h$ exists in both cases.
    Lemma~\ref{lem:sewo:hunique} also clearly shows that this function is unique.

  (a)
  \qproof{
    First, for any $\a \in J$ and $\b \in E$, let $S_\a$ denote the section of $J$ by $\a$, and $T_\b$ denote the section of $E$ by $\b$.
    To avoid ambiguity, also suppose that $<$ is the well-order on $J$ and $\prec$ is the well-order on $E$.
    We show that each of these conditions are equivalent to the condition that $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$ for every $\a \in J$.
    Call this condition (iii).
    This of course also shows that the conditions are equivalent to each other.

    First we show that (i) implies (iii).
    So suppose that $h$ is order preserving and its image is $E$ or a section of $E$.
    Consider any $\a \in J$ and any $y \in h(S_\a)$ so that there is an $x \in S_\a$ where $y = h(x)$.
    Then $x < \a$ and $y = h(x) \prec h(\a)$ since $h$ preserves order.
    Therefore $y \in T_{h(\a)}$ so that $h(S_\a) \ss T_{h(\a)}$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
    Now consider $y \in T_{h(\a)}$ so that $y \prec h(\a)$.
    Since also clearly $y \in E$ (since $T_{h(\a)} \ss E$), $y$ is in the image of $h$ if its image is all of $E$.
    If the image of $h$ is some section of $E$, say $T_\b$, then clearly $h(\a) \in T_\b$ since $h(\a)$ is obviously in the image of $h$.
    Hence we have $y \prec h(\a) \prec \b$ so that $y \in T_\b$ and hence in the image of $h$.
    Since $y$ is in the image of $h$ in either case, there is an $x \in J$ such that $y = h(x)$.
    Then $h(x) = y \prec h(\a)$ so that $x < \a$ since $h$ preserves order.
    Hence $x \in S_\a$ so that $y \in h(S_\a)$ since $y = h(x)$.
    This shows that $T_{h(\a)} \ss h(S_\a)$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
    Therefore $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$ so that condition (iii) is true since $\a$ was arbitrary.

    Next we show that (iii) implies (i).
    So suppose that $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$ for all $\a \in J$.
    First, it is easy to see that $h$ preserves order since, if $x,y \in J$ where $x < y$, then we have that $x \in S_y$ so that clearly $h(x) \in h(S_y) = T_{h(y)}$, and hence $h(x) < h(y)$.
    To show that the image of $h$, i.e. $h(J)$, is either $E$ or a section of $E$, consider the set $E - h(J)$.

    Case: $E - h(J) = \es$.
    Then clearly for any $y \in E$ we must have that $y \in h(J)$ since otherwise it would be that $y \in E - h(J)$.
    Thus $E \ss h(J)$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
    Also clearly $h(J) \ss E$ since $E$ is the range of $h$.
    This shows that $h(J) = E$.

    Case: $E - h(J) \neq \es$.
    Then clearly $E - h(J)$ is a nonempty subset of $E$ so that it has a smallest element $\b$ since $E$ is well-ordered, noting that clearly $\b \notin h(J)$.
    We claim that $h(J) = T_\b$.
    So consider any $y \in h(J)$ so that there is an $x \in J$ where $y = h(x)$.
    Suppose for a moment that $\b \eprec y$.
    Now it cannot be that $\b = y$ since $y \in h(J)$ but $\b \notin h(J)$, and so $\b \prec y$.
    But then $\b \in T_y = T_{h(x)} = h(S_x)$ since $x \in J$.
    Then $\b$ is in the image of $h$ since clearly $h(S_x) \ss h(J)$.
    As this contradicts the fact that $\b \notin h(J)$, it must be that $y \prec \b$ so that $y \in T_\b$.
    This shows that $h(J) \ss T_\b$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
    Suppose now that $y \in T_\b$ so that $y \prec \b$.
    Since $\b$ is the smallest element of $E - h(J)$, it follows that $y \notin E - h(J)$.
    Since clearly $y \in E$ (since $T_\b \ss E$), it must be that $y \in h(J)$.
    This shows that $T_\b \ss h(J)$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
    Hence we have shown that $h(J) = T_\b$.

    Therefore in every case either the image of $h$ is $E$ or a section of $E$ as desired.
    This completes the proof of (i).

    Now we show that (ii) implies (iii).
    So suppose that $h(\a)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$ for every $\a \in J$.
    First we show that $h$ is injective.
    So consider any $x,y \in J$ where $x \neq y$.
    We can assume without loss of generality that $x < y$ so that $x \in S_y$ and hence $h(x) \in h(S_y)$.
    However since we have that $h(y)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_y)$, clearly $h(y) \notin h(S_y)$.
    Therefore we have that $h(x) \neq h(y)$ so that $h$ is injective.
    
    Now consider any $\a \in J$ so that clearly $h(\a)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$.
    Suppose that $y \in h(S_\a)$ so that there is an $x \in S_\a$ where $y = h(x)$, and therefore $x < \a$.
    Consider the possibility that $h(\a) \prece h(x) = y$.
    It cannot be that $h(\a) = h(x) = y$ since $x \neq \a$ and $h$ is injective, so it must be that $h(\a) \prec h(x)$.
    It then follows that $h(\a) \notin E - h(S_x)$ since $h(x)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_x)$.
    Thus $h(\a) \in h(S_x)$ since clearly $h(\a) \in E$.
    It then follows from the fact that $h$ is injective that $\a \in S_x$ so that we have $\a < x < \a$, which is clearly a contradiction.
    So it must be that $y = h(x) \prec h(\a)$ so that $y \in T_{h(\a)}$.
    This shows that $h(S_\a) \ss T_{h(\a)}$ since $y$ was arbitrary.
        
    Now suppose that $y \in T_{h(\a)}$ so that $y \prec h(\a)$.
    Since $h(\a)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$, it follows that $y \notin E - h(S_\a)$.
    Since clearly $y \in E$, it must be that $y \in h(S_\a)$.
    This shows that $T_{h(\a)} \ss h(S_\a)$ since $y$ was arbitrary, and hence $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$, which shows (iii) since $\a$ was arbitrary.

    Lastly, we show that (iii) implies (ii).
    So suppose that $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$ for every $\a \in J$ and consider any such $\a$.
    Clearly we have that $h(\a) \in E$ but $h(\a) \notin T_{h(\a)} = h(S_\a)$ so that $h(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)$.
    Suppose for the moment that $h(\a)$ is not the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$ so that there is a $\b \in E - h(S_\a)$ where $\b \prec h(\a)$.
    Then $\b \in T_{h(\a)}$ so that it must be that $\b \notin E - T_{h(\a)} = E - h(S_\a)$ since $h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}$.
    Clearly this is a contradiction so that it must be that $h(\a)$ really is the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$, which shows (ii) since $\a$ was arbitrary.

\sol{
  \dwhitman

  \qproof{
    First, if $E = \es$ then it must be that $J = \es$ as well so that they vacuously have the same order type.
    Otherwise, following the hint, choose $e_0 \in E$ and define $h: J \to E$ by
    \gath{
      h(\a) = \text{smallest } [E - h(S_\a)] \condgap \text{if} \condgap h(S_\a) \neq E \,,
    }
    and $h(\a) = e_0$ otherwise, noting that this function is uniquely defined by the general principle of recursive definition (Exercise~\thesubsection.1).
    We show that $h(\a) \leq k(\a)$ for all $\a \in J$ using transfinite induction (see Lemma~\ref{lem:wellord:tind}).
    So consider $\a \in J$ and assume that $h(x) \leq k(x)$ for all $x \in S_\a$.
    Since $k$ preserves order we have that $h(x) \leq k(x) < k(\a)$ when $x < \a$.
    In particular, this means that $h(x) \neq k(\a)$ for all $x \in S_\a$ so that $k(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)$.
    Hence $E - h(S_\a)$ is not empty so that $h(S_\a) \neq E$.
    Thus $h(\a)$ is the smallest element of $E - h(S_\a)$ and so $h(\a) \leq k(\a)$ since $k(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)$.
    This completes the induction.

    Therefore, for any $\a \in J$ and any $x < \a$ we have $h(x) \leq k(x) < k(\a)$ since $k$ preserves order so that $h(x) \neq k(\a)$.
    As in the induction step above, it follows that $h(S_\a) \neq E$.
    Hence, since $\a$ was arbitrary,
    \gath{
      h(\a) = \text{smallest } [E - h(S_\a)]
    }
    for all $\a \in J$.
    It then follows from Exercise~\thesubsection.2 part (a) that $h$ is order preserving and maps $J$ onto $E$ or a section of $E$.
    This clearly shows that $J$ has the order type of $E$ or a section of $E$ as desired.

    [Hint: Form a well-ordered set containing both $A$ and $B$, as in Exercise~8 of \S 10; then apply the preceding exercise.]

    Show that $A$ and $B$ have the same order type.

\sol{
  \dwhitman

  (a)
  \qproof{
    First, we can assume that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint since, if not, we can form $A' = \braces{(x,1) \where x \in A}$ and $B' = \braces{(x,2) \where x \in B}$, which clearly \emph{are} disjoint and have the same order types as $A$ and $B$ if ordered in the same way.
    So let $\prec$ be the order on $A \cup B$ as in Exercise~10.8 with all the elements of $A$ before the elements of $B$.
    From the exercise, we know that $A \cup B$ is well-ordered by $\prec$.
    Now, clearly the identity function $i_B$ with $A \cup B$ as the range is an order-preserving function from $B$ to $A \cup B$ so that $B$ is the same order type as $A \cup B$ or a section of $A \cup B$ by Exercise~\thesubsection.3.

    If $B$ has the same order type as $A \cup B$, then there is a an order preserving bijection $g: A \cup B \to B$.
    Let $b$ be the smallest element of $B$ so that $y = g(b) \in B$.
    Since $b$ is the least element of $B$, clearly the section $S_b = \braces{x \in A \cup B \where x \prec b} = A$.
    Also clearly $g(A) = g(S_b) = S_y = \braces{x \in B \where x < y}$ so that $A$ has the same order type as a section of $B$ since $g$ preserves order.

    If $B$ has the same order type as a section of $A \cup B$ then there is an order preserving bijection $f: B \to S_\a$ for some $\a \in A \cup B$.
    If $\a \in A$ then clearly $S_\a$ lies entirely in $A$ and is a section of $A$ so that $B$ has the same order type as a section of $A$.
    So now suppose that $\a \in B$.
    If $\a$ is the smallest element of $B$ then again it has to be that $S_\a$ lies in $A$ and is in fact the enitrety of $A$ so that $B$ and $A$ have the same order type.
    If $\a$ is not the smallest element of $B$ then $S_\a$ contains elements of both $A$ and $B$.
    So let $b$ be the smallest element of $B$ so that $b \in S_\a$, and let $y \in B$ be such that $f(y) = b$, which exists since $f$ is surjective.
    We also have that $S_b = A$ since $b$ is the smallest element of $B$.
    It then follows that $f(S_y) = S_b = A$ since $f(y) = b$ so that $A$ has the same order type as the section $S_y$ of $B$ since $f$ preserves order.

    Hence in all cases one of the desired results always follows.
    To show that exactly one of these is the case, note that if $A$ and $B$ have the same order type then clearly it cannot be that $A$ has the same order type as a section of $B$ since then $B$ would also have the same order type is its own section, which would violate Exercise~\thesubsection.2b.
    Similarly $B$ cannot have the same order type as a section of $A$ since then $A$ would have the same order type as its own section.
    Now suppose that $A$ has the same order type as a section $S_b$ of $B$.
    Then $A$ and $B$ cannot have the same order type since then $B$ would have the same order type as its section $S_b$.
    Also $B$ cannot have the same order type as a section $S_a$ of $A$ since then the section $S_b$, and therefore $A$, would have the same order type as a smaller section of $A$.
    An analogous argument shows the result when $B$ has the same order type as a section of $A$.

  (b)
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $A$ has the same order type as a section of $B$.
    Then there would be a bijection from $A$, an uncountable set, to a section of $B$, which is countable.
    A similar contradiction arises if $B$ were to have the same order type as a section of $A$.
    By part (a), the only remaining possibility is that $A$ and $B$ have the same order type as desired.
