  \qproof{
    Suppose that $A$ is a set with well-ordering $<$, and that $B$ is some nonempty subset of $A$ with upper bound $a \in A$.
    Let $C$ then be the set of upper bounds of $B$, which is not empty since clearly $a \in C$.
    Then $C$ is a nonempty subset of $A$ and so has a smallest element $c$ since $A$ is well-ordered.
    Clearly then $c$ is the least upper bound of $B$ by definition.
    This shows that $A$ has the least upper bound property since $B$ was arbitrary.

  \dwhitman

  (a)
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $A$ is well-ordered by $<$ and consider any $a \in A$ where $a$ is not the largest element.
    It then follows that there is some $x \in A$ where $a < x$ since otherwise $a$ would be the largest element of $A$.
    Let $X = \braces{y \in A \where a < y}$ so that clearly $X \ss A$ and $x \in X$.
    Thus $X$ is a nonempty subset of $A$ and so has a smallest element $b$ since $<$ well-orders $A$.
    We claim that $b$ is the immediate successor of $a$.
    To see this suppose that there is a $z \in A$ such that $a < z < b$, noting that clearly $a < b$ since $b \in X$.
    Then we would have that $z \in X$ but $z < b$ so that it is not true that $b \leq z$, which contradicts the definition of $b$ as the smallest element of $X$.
    So it must be that no such $z$ exists, which shows that $b$ is indeed the immediate successor of $a$.
  }

  (b) The most natural example of such a set is $\ints$.
  We show that this has the desired properties.
  \qproof{
    First, clearly $\ints$ is not well-ordered since, for example, the set of negative integers is a nonempty subset of $\ints$ but has no smallest element.
    Also, for any $n \in \ints$, clearly $n+1$ is the immediate successor of $n$, which was shown back in Corollary~\ref{cor:intreal:intbet}.

\exercise{3}{
  Both $\ot \times \pints$ and $\pints \times \ot$ are well-ordered in the dictionary order.
  Do they have the same order type?
}
\sol{
  \dwhitman

  We claim that they do \emph{not} have the same order type, which we show presently.
  \qproof{
    First, clearly $(1,1)$ is the smallest element of both ordered sets.
    For brevity let $A = \ot \times \pints$, $B = \pints \times \ot$, and $<_A$ and $<_B$ be the corresponding dictionary orderings, with $<$ being the normal ordering of $\pints$.

    So assume that they \emph{do} have the same order type so that there is an order-preserving bijection $f : A \to B$.
    Consider $(2,1) \in A$, which is clearly not the smallest element since $(2,1) \neq (1,1)$.
    Let $(n,b) = f(2,1) \in B$, which cannot be the smallest element of $B$ since $f$ preserves order, so that $(n,b) \neq (1,1)$.
    Clearly $b \in \ot$ so that $b=1$ or $b=2$.
    In the former cases we must have that $n > 1$ so that $n-1 \in \pints$.
    So set $y = (n-1,2)$.
    In the latter case set $y = (n, 1)$.
    It is easy to see, and trivial to formally show, that $y$ is the immediate predecessor of $(n,b)$ in either case.

    Now let $x = \inv{f}(y)$, noting that $\inv{f}$ is an order-preserving bijection from $B$ to $A$ since $f$ is an order-preserving bijection.
    It then follows that $x <_A (2, 1)$ since $f(x) = y <_B (n,b) = f(2,1)$.
    If $x = (m,a)$ then it has to be that $m < 2$ so that $m = 1$ (because $m \in \ot$) since there is no $a \in \pints$ where $a < 1$.
    Thus $x = (1, a)$ for some $a \in \pints$.
    We then have that $a+1 \in \pints$ so that clearly $x = (1, a) <_A (1, a+1) <_A (2,1)$.
    From this we have, $y = f(1,a) <_B f(1,a+1) <_B f(2,1) = (n,b)$, which contradicts the fact that $y$ is the immediate predecessor of $(n,b)$.
    So it has to be that they do not have the same order type.
  }

  It is worth noting that, in the theory of ordinal numbers, $A = \ot \times \pints$ has order type $\w + \w = \w \cdot 2$ whereas $B = \pints \times \ot$ has simply order type $\w$.
  This also shows that $A$ and $B$  have different order types since distinct ordinal numbers always have different order types.

    Show that a simple ordered set $A$ fails to be well-ordered if and only if it contains a subset having the same order type as $\nints$.

  }
}
\sol{
  \dwhitman

  (a)
  \qproof{
    Let $A$ be a set with simple order $\prec$.
    
    $(\imp)$ Suppose that $\prec$ is not a well-ordering of $A$.
    Then there exists a nonempty subset $B$ of $A$ such that $B$ has no smallest element.
    For any $b \in B$ define the set $X_b = \braces{x \in B \where x \prec b}$.
    Clearly $X_b \ss B$ and $X_b \neq \es$ for any $b \in B$ since otherwise $b$ would be the smallest element of $B$.
    Now let $c$ be a choice function on the collection of nonempty subsets of $B$, which of course exists by the axiom of choice.
    Since $B$ is nonempty there is a $b_0 \in B$.
    It then follows from the principle of recursive definition that there is a function $f : \pints \to B$ such that
    \ali{
      f(1) &= b_0 \,, \\
      f(n) &= c(X_{f(n-1)}) \condgap \text{for $n > 1$.}
    }
    It then is easy to show that $f(n+1) \prec f(n)$ for all $n \in \pints$, i.e. that the sequence defined by $f$ is decreasing.
    If we then simply define $g : \nints \to \pints$ by $g(n) = -n$ for $n \in \nints$, it is clear that $f \circ g$ is an order-preserving bijection from $\nints$ to some subset $C$ of $B$.
    Clearly also $C \ss A$ since $B \ss A$.
    Hence the subset $C$ has the same order type as $\nints$.

    $(\pmi)$ Now suppose that $A$ has a subset $B$ with the same order type as $\nints$.
    Clearly then $B$ is nonempty and has no smallest element since $\nints$ does not.
    The existence of this $B$  shows that $A$ fails to be well-ordered.
  }

  (b)
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $A$ is a set that is simply ordered by $\prec$ such that every countable subset is well-ordered by $\prec$.
    Consider any nonempty subset $B \ss A$.
    Suppose for a moment that the restricted $\prec$ does not well-order $B$.
    Then it follows from part (a) that $B$ has a subset $C$ with the same order type as $\nints$.
    However, clearly $C \ss A$ (since $B \ss A$) and $C$ is countable (since $\nints$ is countable) and thus it should be well-ordered.
    As this is impossible since $C$ has the same order-type as $\nints$ (which is clearly not well-ordered), it has to be that the restricted $\prec$ does in fact well-order $B$.
    Hence $B$ has a $\prec$-smallest element, which shows that $A$ is well-ordered since $B$ was arbitrary.

\exercise{5}{
  Show the well-ordering theorem implies the choice axiom.

\sol{
  \dwhitman

  \qproof{
    Suppose that $\col{A}$ is a collection of nonempty sets.
    Then, by the well-ordering theorem there is a well-ordering $<$ of $\bigcup \col{A}$.
    We construct a choice function $c : \col{A} \to \bigcup \col{A}$.
    Consider any set $A \in \col{A}$.
    Since clearly $A$ is then a nonempty subset of $\bigcup \col{A}$, it follows that it has a unique smallest element $a$ according to $<$ since $\bigcup \col{A}$ is well-ordered by $<$.
    So simply set $c(A) = a$ so that clearly then $c(A) = a \in A$.
    This shows that $c$ is in fact a choice function on $\col{A}$.

    If $C$ were countable then $A = C \cup B$ would be countable by Theorem~7.5 since $B$ is also countable.
    Since we know that $A$ is uncountable it therefore must be that $C = A - B$ is uncountable as well.
  }

  \mainprob

  It is assumed in the following that $<$ is the well-order on $S_\W$.
  
  (a)
  \qproof{
    Suppose to the contrary that $S_\W$ does have a largest element $\a$.
    Then, for any $x \in S_\W$, we have that $x \leq \a$.
    Hence either $x \in \braces{y \in S_\W \where y < \a} = S_\a$ or $x = \a$.
    Therefore $S_\W = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$ since clearly both $S_\a$ and $\braces{\a}$ are both subsets of $S_\W$.
    Now since $S_\a$ is a section of $S_\W$, it is countable.
    Since $\braces{\a}$ is also clearly countable, it follows from Theorem~7.5 that their union $S_\a \cup \braces{\a} = S_\W$ is countable.
    But this contradicts the fact that $S_\W$ is uncountable!
    Hence it has to be that $S_\W$ has no largest element as desired.
  }

  (b)
  \qproof{
    Consider any $\a \in S_\W$.
    Let $T_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where \a < x}$ so that we must show that $T_\a$ is uncountable.
    Let $\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$ so that clearly we have that $\bar{S}_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where x \leq \a}$.
    It is then easy to show that $T_\a = S_\W - \bar{S}_\a$.
    Now, since $S_\a$ is a section of $S_\W$, it is countable so that clearly $\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}$ is also countable by Theorem~7.5.
    Then, since $S_\W$ itself is uncountable, it follows that $T_\a = S_\W - \bar{S}_\a$ is also uncountable by Lemma~\ref{lem:wellord:uncount}.
  }

  (c)
  \qproof{
    First we show that $X_0$ is not bounded above.
    Assume the contrary so that $\a \in S_\W$ is an upper bound of $X_0$.
    It then follows that the set $T_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where \a < x}$ is such that every element of $T_\a$ has an immediate predecessor since otherwise there would be a $\b \in T_\a$ where $\b \in X_0$ so that $\a$ would not be an upper bound of $X_0$ since then $\a < \b$.

    Now, we know from part (a) that $S_\W$ has no largest element so that it follows from Exercise~10.2 that every element of $S_\W$ has an immediate successor.
    Since $T_\a \ss S_\W$ it follows that each element $x \in T_\a$ has an immediate successor $y$.
    Moreover we then have that $\a < x < y$ so that $y \in T_\a$ also.
    Hence every element of $T_\a$ has an immediate successor in $T_\a$.
    
    Now, we know that $T_\a$ is uncountable by part (b) so that it has a smallest element $\b$ since it is then a nonempty subset of the well-ordered $S_\W$.
    We derive a contradiction by showing that $T_\a$ has the same order type as $\pints$ and is thus countable.
    We do this by defining an increasing bijection $f: \pints \to T_\a$.
    First, set $f(1) = \b$ and then set $f(n)$ to the immediate successor of $f(n-1)$ for $n > 1$, which was shown to exist above.
    Then the function $f$ uniquely exists by the principle of recursive definition.
    Clearly we have that $f(n+1) > f(n)$ for all $n \in \pints$ since $f(n+1)$ is the immediate successor of $f(n)$.
    Hence $f$ is increasing and therefore also injective.

    To show that $f$ is surjective suppose the contrary so that the set $T_\a - f(\pints)$ is nonempty.
    Since clearly this is a subset of the well-ordered $S_\W$, it has a smallest element $y$.
    Now, we know that $f(1) = \b$ so that $y \neq \b$, and in fact $\b < y$ since $\b$ is the smallest element of $T_\a$.
    Since $y \in T_\a$ we know that it has an immediate predecessor $x$ and that $\a < \b \leq x$ so that $x \in T_\a$.
    However, it cannot be that $x \in T_\a - f(\pints)$ since $x < y$ and $y$ is the smallest element of $T_\a - f(\pints)$.
    Thus $x \in f(\pints)$ so that there is an $n \in \pints$ where $f(n) = x$.
    But then $f(n+1) = y$ since $y$ is the immediate successor of $x$.
    As this contradicts the fact that $y \notin f(\pints)$, it must be that $f$ is in fact surjective!

    Therefore we have shown that $f$ is a bijection from $\pints$ to $T_\a$ so that $T_\a$ is countable.
    But we know from part (b) that $T_\a$ is uncountable.
    As mentioned above, this is a contradiction so that it must be that indeed $X_0$ is not bounded above.
    From this it immediately follows from the contrapositive of Theorem~10.3 that $X_0$ must be uncountable.
  }

  It is interesting to note that $S_\W$ corresponds to the ordinal number $\w_1$, which is the first uncountable ordinal, and the set $X_0$ of part (c) corresponds to the set of limit ordinals in $\w_1$.
  All of the curious properties deduced here for $S_\W$ apply to $\w_1$ too, assuming we allow the choice axiom.

  \qproof{
    Suppose that $J_0$ is an inductive subset of the well-ordered set $J$.
    Also suppose that $J_0 \neq J$.
    Since $J_0 \ss J$, it follows that there must be an $x \in J$ such that $x \notin J_0$.
    Thus the set $J - J_0$ is nonempty.
    Since clearly this is also a subset of $J$, it must have a smallest element $\a$ since $J$ is well-ordered.
    Consider any $y \in S_\a$ so that $y < \a$.
    Then it cannot be that $y \in J - J_0$ since otherwise $\a$ would not be the smallest element of $J - J_0$.
    Since clearly $y \in J$ (since $S_\a \ss J$) it has to be that $y \in J_0$.
    Since $y$ was arbitrary this shows that $S_\a \ss J_0$.
    It then follows that $\a \in J_0$ since $J_0$ is inductive.
    However, this contradicts the fact that $\a \in J - J_0$ so that our initial supposition that $J_0 \neq J$ must be incorrect.
    Hence $J_0 = J$ as desired.

\sol{
  \dwhitman

  (a)
  \qproof{
    It is easy but tedious to show that $<$ is actually an order on $A_1 \cup A_2$, so we shall skip that proof and jump straight to the proof that it is a well-ordering.

    So consider any nonempty subset $A$ of $A_1 \cup A_2$.

    Case: $A_1 \cap A \neq \es$.
    Then clearly $A_1 \cap A$ is a nonempty subset of $A_1$ so that it has a smallest element $a$ according to $<_1$ since it is a well-ordering.
    We then claim that $a$ is the smallest element of $A$ according to $<$.
    So consider any $x \in A$ so that clearly also $x \in A_1 \cup A_2$.
    Hence $x \in A_1$ or $x \in A_2$.
    If $x \in A_1$ then obviously $x \in A_1 \cap A$ so that $a \leq_1 x$ since $a$ is the smallest element of $A_1 \cap A$.
    Then also $a \leq x$ by definition since $a$ and $x$ are both in $A_1$.
    On the other hand, if $x \in A_2$ then we again have that $a < x$ since $a \in A_1$ and $x \in A_2$.
    Therefore $a \leq x$ no matter what so that $a$ is the smallest element of $A$ since $x$ was arbitrary.

    Case: $A_1 \cap A = \es$.
    Then it has to be that $A_2 \cap A \neq \es$ since $A$ is nonempty and $A = A_1 \cup A_2$.
    Thus $A_2 \cap A$ is a nonempty subset of $A_2$ so that it has a smallest element $a$ by $<_2$ since it is a well-ordering.
    We claim that $a$ is the smallest element of $A$.
    So consider any $x \in A$.
    It has to be that $x \in A_2$ since $A_1 \cap A$ is empty and $A = A_1 \cup A_2$.
    Therefore $x \in A_2 \cap A$ so that $a \leq_2 x$ since $a$ is the smallest element of $A_2 \cap A$.
    Then, by definition, $a \leq x$ since both $a$ and $x$ are elements of $A_2$.
    This shows that $a$ is the smallest element of $A$ since $x$ was arbitrary.

    In either case we have shown that $A$ has a smallest element so that $<$ is a well-ordering of $A_1 \cup A_2$ since $A$ was arbitrary.
  }

  Note that well-ordering a union of two well-ordered sets like this is analogous to the addition of two ordinal numbers.
  In particular if $A_1$ has order type $\a_1$ and $A_1$ has order type $\a_2$ where $\a_1$ and $\a_2$ are an ordinal numbers, then $A_1 \cup A_2$ with the above well-ordering has order type $\a_1 + \a_2$.

  (b) Suppose that $J$ is well-ordered by $<_J$ and $\braces{A_\a}_{\a \in J}$ is a collection of well-ordered sets where $A_\a$ is well-ordered by $<_\a$ for each $\a \in J$.
  Now define an order $<$ on $A = \bigcup_{\a \in J} A_\a$ as follows.
  For any $x$ and $y$ in $A$ there are clearly $\a$ and $\b$ in $J$  where $x \in A_\a$ and $y \in A_\b$, noting that $\a$ and $\b$ are unique since the collection is mutually disjoint.
  So set $x < y$ if and only if either $\a = \b$ and $x <_\a y$, or else $\a <_J \b$, noting that these are clearly mutually exclusive.
  We then claim that $<$ is a well-ordering of $A$.
  \qproof{
    Let $B$ be any nonempty subset of $A$ and $I$ be the set of $\a \in J$ such that there is an $x \in B$ where $x \in A_\a$.
    Now, since $B$ is nonempty, there is a $z \in B$.
    Since $B \ss A = \bigcup_{\a \in J} A_\a$, there is an $\g \in J$ where $z \in A_\g$.
    Then clearly $\g \in I$ so that $I$ is a nonempty subset of $J$.
    Then $I$ has a smallest element $\a$ since it is well-ordered by $<_J$.
    By the definition of $I$ there is a $w \in B$ where $w \in A_\a$.
    Then clearly $w \in A_\a \cap B$ so that it is a nonempty subset of $A_\a$.
    It then follows that $A_\a \cap B$ has a smallest element $a$ according to $<_\a$ since it is a well-ordering on $A_\a$.
    We claim that $a$ is the smallest element of $B$ by $<$.

    So consider any $x \in B$ so that there is a $\b \in J$ where $x \in A_\b$ since $B \ss A$.

    Case: $\b = \a$.
    Then both $a$ and $x$ are in $A_\a \cap B = A_\b \cap B$ so that $a \leq_\a b$ since $a$ is the smallest element of $A_\a \cap B$.
    It then follows from the definition of $<$ that $a \leq x$.

    Case: $\b \neq \a$.
    Clearly then $\b \in I$ so that $\a \leq_J \b$ since $\a$ is the smallest element of $J$.
    Since we know that $\b \neq \a$ it must be that $\a <_J \b$.
    From this it follows that $a < x$ by definition.

    Hence in either case it is true that $a \leq x$, which shows that $a$ is the smallest element of $B$.
    Since $B$ was an arbitrary nonempty subset of $A$, this shows that $A$ is well-ordered by $<$.

    Consider any positive integer $n$.

      a_i = \begin{cases}
        2 & i = n + 1 \\
        1 & i \neq n + 1 \,.
      \end{cases}
    }
    We claim that the section $S_\va$ has the same order type as $(\pints)^n$.
    To show this we construct an order-preserving mapping $f: S_\va \to (\pints)^n$.
    So consider any sequence $\vx = (x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ in $S_\va$ so that $\vx < \va$.
    Now define a finite sequence where $y_i = x_{n-i+1}$ for any $i \in \intsfin{n}$, and set $f(\vx) = \vy = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$.
    Clearly $f(\vx) \in (\pints)^n$ since $\vx \in A \ss (\pints)^\w$.

    Here we must digress for a moment and show that, for all  $\vx = (x_1, x_2, \ldots) \in A$, $\vx \in S_\va$ if and only if $x_i = 1$ for all $i > n$.

    $(\imp)$ We show the contrapositive.
    So suppose that there is an $i > n$ where $x_i \neq 1$.
    Moreover let $i$ be the greatest such index, which must exist since $\vx$ must end in an infinite string of 1's.
    Clearly then the fact that $x_i \in \pints$ and $x_i \neq 1$ means that $x_i > 1$.
    Now, if $i > n+1$ then we have that $x_i > 1 = a_i$ and $x_j = 1 = a_j$ for all $j > i$ so that clearly $\vx > \va$.
    If $i = n + 1$ and $i > 2$ clearly $x_i > 2 = a_{n+1} = a_i$ and $x_j = 1 = a_j$ for all $j > i$ so that again $\vx > \va$.
    Lastly suppose that $i = n+1$ but that $x_i = 2 = a_{n+1} = a_i$.
    If $x_j = 1 = a_j$ for all $j < i = n+1$ then clearly $\vx = \va$.
    On the other hand if there is a $1 \leq j < n+1 = i$ where $x_j \neq 1$ then let $j$ be the greatest such index.
    Then we clearly have $x_j > 1 = a_j$ while $x_k = a_k$ for all $k > j$ so that $\vx > \va$.
    Therefore in every one of these exhaustive cases we have that $\vx \geq \va$ so that $\va \notin S_\va$.

    $(\pmi)$ Now suppose that $x_i = 1$ for every $i > n$.
    Then we have that $x_{n+1} = 1 < 2 = a_{n+1}$ while $x_j = 1 = a_j$ for all $j > n+1 > n$ so that $\vx < \va$ and hence $\vx \in S_\va$.

    Now, returning to the main proof, we first show that $f$ as defined above preserves order.
    To this end let $\prec$ denote the dictionary order on $(\pints)^n$.
    Now consider any $\vx = (x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ and $\vx' = (x_1', x_2', \ldots)$ in $S_\va$ where $\vx < \vx'$.
    Also let $\vy = f(\vx)$ and $\vy' = f(\vx')$.
    Then there is an $m \in \pints$ where $x_m < x_m'$ and $x_i = x_i'$ for all $i > m$.
    We also have by what was shown above that $x_i = 1 x_i'$ for all $i > n$ since $\vx,\vx' \in S_\va$.
    So it has to be that $m \leq n$.
    It then follows from the fact that $1 \leq m \leq n$ that $1 \leq n-m+1 \leq n$ as well.
    Thus we have
    \gath{
      y_{n-m+1} = x_{n-(n-m+1)+1} = x_m < x_m' = x_{n-(n-m+1)+1}' = y_{n-m+1}' \,.
    }
    For any $1 \leq j < n-m+1$ we have that $n-j+1 > m$ so that
    \gath{
      y_j = x_{n-j+1} = x_{n-j+1}' = y_j' \,.
    }
    Thus by definition we have that $f(\vx) = \vy \prec \vy' = f(\vx')$, which shows that $f$ preserves order since $\vx$ and $\vx'$ were arbitrary.
    Note that this also clearly shows that $f$ is injective.

    To show that $f$ is also surjective, consider any $\vy = (y_1, \ldots, y_n) \in (\pints)^n$.
    Now define a sequence
    \gath{
      x_i = \begin{cases}
        y_{n-i+1} & 1 \leq i \leq n \\
        1 & i > n
      \end{cases}
    }
    so that clearly $\vx = (x_1, x_2, \ldots) \in S_\va$ by what was shown above.
    Now let $\vy' = (y_1', \ldots y_n') = f(\vx)$.
    Consider any $1 \leq i \leq n$ and let $j = n-i+1$ so that also $n-j+1 = i$, noting also that $1 \leq j \leq n$.
    Then we have
    \gath{
      y_i = y_{n-j+1} = x_j = x_{n-i+1} = y_i'
    }
    by the definition of $f$.
    Since $i$ was arbitrary this shows that $f(\vx) = \vy' = \vy$, which shows that $f$ is surjective since $\vy$ was arbitrary.

    The existence of $f$ therefore shows that $S_\va$ and $(\pints)^n$ have the same order type.

  (b)
  \qproof{
    Consider any nonempty subset $B$ of $A$.
    Clearly the sequence $(1,1, \ldots)$ is the smallest element of $A$ and hence if it is in $B$ then it is also the smallest element of $B$.
    So suppose that $(1,1,\ldots) \notin B$ so that, for every $\vx \in B$ there is a unique greatest $n_\vx \in \pints$ where $x_{n_\vx} > 1$ but $x_i = 1$ for all $i > n_\vx$.
    So let $I = \braces{n_\vx \where \vx \in B}$, noting that $B \neq \es$ implies that $I \neq \es$ as well.
    Thus $I$ is a nonempty subset of $\pints$ and hence has a smallest element $n$.
    If we then let $B_n$ be the set of sequences $\vx \in B$ where $x_n > 1$ but $x_i = 1$ for all $i > n$, then the fact that $n \in I$ clearly implies that $B_n \neq \es$.
    Also, if we define the sequence
    \gath{
      a_i = \begin{cases}
        2 & i = n+1 \\
        1 & i \neq n+1
      \end{cases}
    }
    as in part (a) then it follows from what was shown there that $B_n \ss S_\va$.
    Moreover it was shown that $S_\va$ has the same order type as the dictionary order of $(\pints)^n$, which we know to be a well-ordering.
    Hence $S_\va$ must also be a well-ordering so that $B_n$ has a smallest element $\vb = (b_1, b_2, \ldots)$ since it is a nonempty subset of $S_\va$.
    We claim that $\vb$ is in fact the smallest element of all of $B$.

    So consider any $\vx \in B$ so that $n_\vx \in I$.
    It then follows that $n \leq n_\vx$ since it is the smallest element of $I$.
    If $n = n_\vx$ then we have that $\vx \in B_n$ so that $\vb \leq \vx$ since it is the smallest element of $B_n$.
    If $n < n_\vx$ then we have that $b_{n_\vx} = 1 < x_{n_\vx}$ but $b_i = 1 = x_i$ for every $i > n_\vx > n$.
    This shows that $\vb < \vx$.
    Thus in all cases $\vb \leq \vx$, which shows that $\vb$ is the smallest element of $B$ since $\vx$ was arbitrary.
    Since $B$ was arbitrary, this shows that $A$ is well-ordered as desired.
