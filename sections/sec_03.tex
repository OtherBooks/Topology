  Define two points $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ of the plane to be equivalent if $y_0 - x_0^2 = y_1 - x_1^2$.
  Check that this is an equivalence relation and describe the equivalence classes.

  First we show that this relation, which we shall denote with $\sim$, is an equivalence relation.
  \qproof{
    In what follows, suppose that $\ppt{0}$, $\ppt{1}$, and $\ppt{2}$ are all points in the plane.
    
    (Reflexivity) Of course we have $y_0 - x_0^2 = y_0 - x_0^2$, and hence $\ppt{0} \sim \ppt{0}$.

    (Symmetry) Suppose that $\ppt{0} \sim \ppt{1}$.
    Then we have $y_0 - x_0^2 = y_1 - x_1^2$ so that of course $y_1 - x_1^2 = y_0 - x_0^2$ since numerical equality is symmetric, and so $\ppt{1} \sim \ppt{0}$ as well.

    (Transitivity) Suppose that $\ppt{0} \sim \ppt{1}$ and $\ppt{1} \sim \ppt{2}$.
    Then $y_0 - x_0^2 = y_1 - x_1^2$ and $y_1 - x_1^2 = y_2 - x_2^2$ so that of course $y_0 - x_0^2 = y_2 - x_2^2$ since numerical equality is transitive.
    Therefore $\ppt{0} \sim \ppt{2}$, which shows transitivity.

    This suffices to show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation as we set out to show.
