  Let $\cC$ be the collection of sets that are alleged to be a basis for the box topology in Theorem~19.2.
  \qproof{
    We show that $\cC$ is a basis of the box topology using Lemma~13.2.
    First, it is easy to see that $\cC$ is a collection of open sets.
    Consider any $B = \cC$ so that $B = \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a$ where each $B_\a \in \cB_\a$.
    Since each $B_\a$ is a basis element of $X_\a$, they are open so that $B$ is a basis element of the box topology by definition and therefore open.
    
    Now suppose that $U$ is an any open set of the box topology and consider any $x \in U$.
    Then it follows that there is a basis element $\prod_{\a \in J} U_\a$  of the box topology containing $x$ where $\prod_{\a \in J} U_\a \ss U$.
    Thus each $U_\a$ is an open set of $X_\a$ by the definition of the box topology.
    Also $x \in \prod_{\a \in J} U_\a$ so that $x = (x_\a)_{\a \in J}$ where each $x_\a \in U_\a$.
    It then follows that there is basis element $B_\a \in \cB_\a$ of $X_\a$ containing $x_\a$ where $B_\a \ss U_\a$, noting that choosing a basis element $B_\a$ for each $\a \in J$ requires the choice axiom.
    
    Then clearly $x \in \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a$ and $\prod_{\a \in J} B_\a \in \cC$.
    Consider also any $y \in \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a$ so that $y = (y_\a)_{\a \in J}$ where each $y_\a \in B_\a$.
    Then also each $y_\a \in U_\a$ since $B_\a \ss U_\a$.
    This suffices to show that $y \in \prod_{\a \in J} U_\a \ss U$.
    Since $y$ was arbitrary this shows that $\prod_{\a \in J} B_\a \ss U$.
    Therefore $\cC$ is a basis of the box topology by Lemma~13.2.
  }

  Now let $\cC$ be the set alleged to be a basis for the product topology in Theorem~19.2.
  \qproof{
    Recall that the general product topology is defined in terms of its subbasis
    \gath{
      \cS = \bigcup_{\b \in J} \cS_\b \,,
    }
    where
    \gath{
      \cS_\b = \braces{\inv{\pi_\b}(U_\b) \where \text{$U_\b$ open in $X_\b$}}\,.
    }
    We again use Lemma~13.2 and so must first show that $\cC$ is a collection of open sets.
    We do this by showing that each element is a finite intersection of elements of the subbasis $\cS$.
    So consider any $B = \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a \in \cC$ and let $I$ be the finite subset of $J$ such that $B_\a \in \cB_\a$ for $\a \in I$ and $B_\a = X_\a$ for $\a \in J - I$.
    Then let
    \gath{
      B_S = \bigcap_{\b \in I} \inv{\pi_\b}(B_\b).
    }
    First, since each $B_\b$ for $\b \in I$ is open in $X_\b$, we have that $\inv{\pi_\b}(B_\b) \in \cS_\b$ so that $\inv{\pi_\b}(B_\b) \in \cS$.
    Hence $B_S$ is a finite intersection of subbasis elements and so is in the basis of the product topology.

    Now we claim that $B = B_S$.
    So first consider any $x \in B$ so that $x = (x_\a)_{\a \in J}$ where each $x_\a \in B_\a$.
    Now consider any $\b \in I$ so that $x \in \inv{\pi_\b}(B_\b)$ since $\pi_\b(x) = x_\b \in B_\b$.
    Since $\b$ was arbitrary, this shows that $x \in B_S$ so that $B \ss B_S$.
    Now consider $x \in B_S$ so that $x \in \inv{\pi_\b}(B_\b)$ for every $\b \in I$.
    Suppose $\a \in J$.
    If $\a \in I$ then $x \in \inv{\pi_\a}(B_\a)$ so that $x_\a = \pi_\a(x) \in B_\a$.
    If $\a \notin I$ then of course $x_\a \in X_\a = B_\a$ since $x$ is a point in the topological space $\prod_{\a \in I} X_\a$.
    Thus either way $x_\a \in B_\a$ so that $x \in B$.
    Hence $B \sps B_S$ so that $B = B_S$ as desired.
    This of course shows that $B$ is a basis element of the product topology and so is open.
    Since $B$ was arbitrary this shows that $\cC$ is a collection of open sets.

    Now consider any open set $U$ of the product topology and any $x \in U$ so that there is a basis element $B_S$ where $x \in B_S \ss U$.
    Since $B_S$ is a basis element of the product topology defined by its subbasis, $B_S$ is a finite intersection of subbasis elements.
    Hence there is a finite $I \ss J$ where
    \gath{
      B_S = \bigcap_{\b \in I} \inv{\pi_\b}(U_\b)
    }
    for some open sets $U_B$ of $X_B$.
    Since $x \in B_S$ where have that $x \in \inv{\pi_\b}(U_\b)$ for all $\b \in I$.
    Thus $x = (x_\a)_{\a \in J}$ and $\pi_\b(x) = x_\b \in U_\b$ for every $\b \in I$ (and of course $x_\a \in X_\a$ for any $\a \notin I$).
    Then, for every $\b \in I$ we have $x_\b \in U_\b$ so that there is a basis element $B_\b \in \cB_\b$ of $X_\b$ where $x_\b \in B_\b \ss U_\b$.
    Note that this does not require the choice axiom as we are only choosing a finite number of basis elements $B_\b$.
    Letting $B = \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a$ where $B_\a = X_\a$ for $\a \notin I$, clearly $x \in B$ and $B \in \cC$.

    Lastly, consider any $y = (y_\a)_{\a \in J} \in B$ so that $y_\a \in B_\a$ for all $\a \in I$.
    Now consider any $\b \in I$ so that $y_\b \in B_\b$ and hence also $y_\b \in U_\b$ since $B_\b \ss U_\b$.
    We then have that $\pi_\b(y) = y_\b \in U_\b$ so that $y \in \inv{\pi_\b}(U_\b)$.
    Since $\b \in I$ was arbitrary, this shows that $y \in B_S$ and hence also $y \in U$ since $B_S \ss U$.
    Since $y$ was arbitrary, this shows that $x \in B \ss U$, which suffices to show that $\cC$ is a basis for the product topology by Lemma~13.2.

  \qproof{
    The basis of the box or product topologies on $\prod A_\a$ is the collection of sets $\prod V_\a$, where each $V_\a$ is open in $A_\a$ and, in the case of the product topology, $V_\a = A_\a$ for all but finitely many $\a \in J$ (by Theorem~19.1).
    Denote this basis collection by $\cC$.
    By Lemma~16.1, the collection
    \gath{
      \cB_A = \braces{B \cap \prod A_\a \where B \in \cB}
    }
    is a basis of the subspace topology on $\prod A_\a$, where $\cB$ is the basis of $\prod X_\a$.
    To prove that $\prod A_\a$ is a subspace of $\prod X_\a$, it therefore suffices to show that $\cC = \cB_A$.

    $(\ss)$ First consider any element $B \in \cC$ so that $B = \prod V_\a$ for open sets $V_\a$ in $A_\a$ (and $V_\a = A_\a$ for all but finite many $\a \in J$ for the product topology).
    For each $\a \in J$, we then have that $V_\a = U_\a \cap A_\a$ for some open set $U_\a$ in $X_\a$ since $A_\a$ is a subspace of $X_\a$.
    Note that this is true even for those $\a$ where $V_\a = A_\a$ in the product topology since then $V_\a = A_\a = X_\a \cap A_\a$.
    In fact, for these $\a$ we need to choose $U_\a = X_\a$ as will become apparent.
    We then have the following:
    \ali{
      x \in B &\bic x \in \prod V_\a \\
      &\bic \forall \a \in J (x_\a \in V_\a) \\
      &\bic \forall \a \in J (x_\a \in U_\a \cap A_\a) \\
      &\bic \forall \a \in J (x_\a \in U_\a \land x_\a \in A_\a) \\
      &\bic \forall \a \in J (x_\a \in U_\a) \land \forall \a \in J (x_\a \in A_\a) \\
      &\bic x \in \prod U_\a \land x \in \prod A_\a \\
      &\bic x \in \parens{\prod U_\a} \cap \parens{\prod A_\a} \,,
    }
    Since $U_\a = X_\a$ for all but a finitely many $\a \in J$ for the product topology, we have that $\prod U_\a$ is a basis element of $\prod X_\a$, i.e. $\prod U_\a \in \cB$.
    This shows that $B \in \cB_A$ so that $\cC \ss \cB_A$ since $B$ was arbitrary.

    $(\sps)$ Now suppose that $B \in \cB_A$ so that $B = B_X \cap \prod A_\a$ for some basis element $B_X \in \cB$ of $\prod X_\a$.
    We then have that $B_X = \prod U_\a$ where each $U_\a$ is an open set of $X_\a$ (and $U_\a = X_\a$ for all but finitely many $\a \in J$ for the product topology).
    Then let $V_\a = U_\a \cap A_\a$ for each $\a \in J$, noting that $V_\a = X_\a \cap A_\a = A_\a$ when $U_\a = X_\a$.
    Following the above chain of logical equivalences in reverse order then shows that $B = \prod V_\a$ so that $B \in \cC$ since clearly each $V_\a$ is open in the subspace topology $A_\a$.
    Hence $\cC \sps \cB_A$ since $B$ was arbitrary.
