Topology by James Munkres (2nd Edition) Solutions Manual
========================================================

The main solutions manual is `solutions.tex`.

When doing exercises it can be useful to see a list of lemmas that have been written as part of the solutions.
Running the `lemmas.py` Python script will build `lemmas_content.tex` that contains these lemmas.
You can then build a lemma list document by compiling `lemmas.tex`, which includes `lemmas_content.tex`.
